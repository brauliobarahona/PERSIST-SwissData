Project description: Positive EneRgy diStrIctS driven by ciTizens (PERSIST) project aims to achieve a better understanding of how socio­economic, socio-cultural, and socio-political factors shape PEDs and their interrelations with technological, regulatory, and investment aspects across different geographical, cultural, and economic contexts. The project investigates the relevant conditions for PEDs across Europe and identifies the most relevant participation archetypes to develop decarbonization scenarios for an optimized flexible and participative Energy System, in an Urban Living Lab (ULL) or pilot project setting. PERS IT benefits from a strong network of urban living labs (or specific pilot projects of PEDs) that represent different social practices and regulatory contexts within Europe. We expect to observe different cognitive norms (e.g., social aspirations, expected conform levels, environmental concerns), different energy practices or regulations (e.g., available technology and resources, marketing practices and stakeholders, price structures).
